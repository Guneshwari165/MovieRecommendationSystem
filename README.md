1.	Problem Statement
   
With the vast amount of content available on streaming platforms, users often struggle to find movies that align with their preferences. Existing recommendation systems provide generic suggestions that lack personalization and often fail to consider a user's mood, watch history, or genre preferences. This leads to a poor user experience and underutilization of platform content. There is a need for an intelligent, personalized movie recommendation system that delivers accurate and meaningful suggestions.

2.	Proposed Solution
   
The proposed solution is an AI-powered movie recommendation system that leverages machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and real-time user feedback to suggest movies tailored to individual user profiles. The system combines content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and sentiment analysis to deliver highly personalized suggestions. Key features include:
Personalized recommendations based on viewing history and preferences
Mood and genre-based filtering
Real-time feedback integration to improve results
User profile creation for better targeting

4.	Solution Architecture & Workflow
   
 User Interface: Users input preferences, select moods, or rate movies.
 Data Layer: User data, ratings, and movie metadata are stored in a database.
 Recommendation Engine:
Content-based filtering analyzes genres, actors, and keywords.
Collaborative filtering compares user behavior with similar profiles.
NLP processes movie descriptions and user reviews for sentiment analysis.
Feedback Loop: User feedback helps retrain the model and improve recommendations.
Output: Movies are recommended and displayed on the UI.

5.	Feasibility & Challenges
   
Feasibility: The project is highly feasible due to the availability of movie datasets (e.g., MovieLens), APIs (TMDb), and open-source ML libraries. The system can be prototyped and tested with limited resources.
Challenges:
Cold Start Problem: For new users, limited data may reduce accuracy. Solution: Use demographic-based suggestions or ask initial preference questions.
Data Privacy: Ensuring user data is handled securely. Solution: Anonymize data and follow privacy regulations.
Scalability: Handling large user bases and data volumes. Solution: Use cloud infrastructure and optimize algorithms.
